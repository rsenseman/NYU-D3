# NYU-D3

This repo hosts my work done as part of the ["Programming with D3.js" course from NYU](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-programming-d3js/). The final assignment, creating responsive data vizualization of the top airlines' routes, is hosted via Github Pages at https://rsenseman.github.io/NYU-D3/

Through this course I learned the basic skills of D3 including:
* loading and manipulating data
* drawing lines, maps and other basic plotting techniques
* linking vizualizations to create a responsive UX
