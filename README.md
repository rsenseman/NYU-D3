# NYU-D3

This repo hosts my work done as part of the ["Programming with D3.js" course from NYU](https://www.coursera.org/learn/information-visualization-programming-d3js/). 

Final Assignment Output [here](https://rsenseman.github.io/NYU-D3/)

For the final assignment, linked [here](https://rsenseman.github.io/NYU-D3/) and above, I created a responsive data vizualization of the top airlines' routes; the simple web app is hosted via Github Pages. The code for the simple html homepage is in [index.html](./index.html); the bulk of the work was done in the linked javascript file [d3_work.js](./d3_work.js)

Through this course I learned the basic skills of D3 including:
* loading and manipulating data
* drawing lines, maps and other basic plotting techniques
* linking vizualizations to create a responsive UX
